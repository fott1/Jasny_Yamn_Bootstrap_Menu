# Jasny_Yamn_Bootstrap_Menu
A mixed menu that includes features from Jasny, Yamn and main Bootstrap menu code

I was playing around with bootstrap framework when i wanted to use the main bootstrap menu together with a pull right method instead of having a dropdown toggle.

So created quickly a solution. Not the best practice but still useful.

# Pros 

1. Integrates several features and includes pull right menu for tablets and mobiles
2. Does not use any additional js.
3. I like cover background photos :)

# Cons

1. Lacks of styling
2. It loads together 2 menus using, "Display: none" on one of them depending the screen width, in css file.
3. I am sure there are more! 

# Summary 

- it's ok.
